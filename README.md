# Diwali_Sales_Analysis
I made this project for Analytics on Diwali Sales.
I used Pyhton (Numpy,Pandas,Matplotlib,SimpleImputer) for it.
The goal of this project is to analyze sales data from Diwali and provide insights on customer behavior, popular products, and regional sales trends. The analysis is based on a dataset that includes information about customer demographics, product details, and sales amounts.
